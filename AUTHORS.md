Rubeus Engine was under development at SDSLabs, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee
from the mid-May of 2018. During the late winters of 2018, Rubeus Engine was open-sourced
publicly after most of its sub-systems had achieved a working condition.

## Motivation
The main motivation behind building a game engine like Rubeus was to help people at
SDSLabs develop a non-commercial concept game project, which is yet to be announced
officially.

However, the motivation behind making Rubeus publicly open-source was mainly to help
attract talents from various fields and bringing developers together to create a user-friendly, powerful and efficient game engine capable of realising custom-made video game ideas.
