## <a name=what>What is Rubeus?
  
A cross-platform 2D game engine written in C++17 using OpenGL 3.3. The main objective of making this engine is to provide a simple and fast API to help people realize their game ideas efficiently.

Rubeus is currently a work in progress. We also invite you to contribute to this engine along with us. Head [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) to read the contributing guidelines. You can also talk to all the fellow contributors at <a href=https://chat.sdslabs.co>SDSLabs' chat hookup</a>.
  
## <a name=why>Why is Rubeus?
Rubeus was at first an initiative by SDSLabs to inculcate the spirit of game development amongst the members of this organisation. But after Rubeus achieved a slightly mature state, we realised that it would be best for the development of this project if we get inputs from game engine developers across the open source community, and build this together.

As previously said, we do not expect to have any monetary gains off making this project open-source, nor from any of the games that we might be developing on Rubeus.

## <a name=how>How can I contribute?
Anyone is invited to contribute to Rubeus either through [opening issues](CONTRIBUTING.md) on Github, making [pull requests](CONTRIBUTING.md), adding [Wiki pages](https://github.com/sdslabs/Rubeus/wiki), talking to the community at [our chat website](https://chat.sdslabs.co).

## <a name=when>When can I use Rubeus?
All game engine core sub-systems are in place and a final architecture is the current goal to achieve. We can have a release when that's done. 

## <a name=remarks>Remarks
* A work in production
  * Guerrilla Renderer, the main rendering engine, highly inspired by the [Sparky Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Sparky)
  * Awerere Physics collision system, the physics update engine using a homebrewed maths library i.e. Rubeus Maths Library (RML)
  * Symphony Audio Engine, audio effects and cueing engine using SFML as it's backend.
  * Easy to use workflow, efforts are being made to release as little information to the user without compromising flexibility.
