## <a name=ig>Issue Guidelines
All issues should try to follow the basic structure described [here](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).
Other than that, you can make certain changes to the structure if absolutely necessary, while preserving the motivation for having issue guidelines.

To open an issue, go to https://github.com/sdslabs/Rubeus/issues and select `New Issue`. Using [this](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) template, you can now add a new issue complying with the Rubeus guidelines.

## <a name=pr>Pull Request Guidelines
Before starting to work on a PR(Pull Request) or opening a new PR, it helps everyone here to be mentally clear with what purpose it is supposed to serve.

Make sure your PR does any one(or more) of the following:
1. Proposes a fix to an issue present [here](https://github.com/sdslabs/Rubeus/issues)
2. Adds a desirable new feature to Rubeus or to any of it's extended components, earlier discussed with other developers contributing to Rubeus.
3. Adds or fixes documentation for certain less frequented parts of Rubeus(no one says 'no' to more documentation)
4. Has `WIP` in its title, so that it is regarded as a 'Work In Progress' and doesn't get merged accidently.

Before starting to work on Rubeus, it will help you in designing your code if you meet the code conventions followed in the rest of the engine.

After you have finished working on your PR, go through the below list of last minute checks you might want to do:
1. There are no silly typos in identifiers
2. Code style is similar to the rest of the source code
3. There are no build errors

Other than the points above, if there are any problems with your code, the contributors shall give you feedback and guide you to correct your code accordingly.
After the purpose of the PR is minimally fulfilled, make sure to remove `WIP` from the PR title and ping any of the code reviewers to let them have a final skim.
